1. Go to folder in requirejs-demo  in this same module it self.
That folder is just for example of requireJS,  there is no any relation with magento module.
(go in that folder and open the index.html file in your browser)


IF you want to check how magenot including the require js 

vendor/magento/module-theme/view/frontend/layout/default.xml - go on line no 12.
this file is loaded on every single page of magento.

and you can check where that js is coming from 
is  "root/lib/web/requirejs"

2.Let's create our first requirejs-config.js  (config file)
if you want to check how this requirejs-config.js is loading and configured 

run this below command in magento root
grep -R "requirejs-config.js" src/vendor/magento/
